It has been discovered that the implementation (in R) used
by the DVN application depended on certain features and/or
behavior specific to R, essentially making it very difficult
to port (meaning, to implement on another platform exactly
replicating the behavior of the old UNF:3 implementation).

Known issues with the implementation: 


1. Loss of precision/rounding in processing floating point
   values exracted from Stata files during the ingest. 

   For both "float" and "double" floating
   point values, the resulting value in the tab-delimited
   file was printed using perl 'sprintf "%g"' function, which
   reduced precision to 6 decimal digits before and after
   the decimal point (UNF uses 7 internally). 

2. Date/Time values: 

   It was discovered that the vector, on which the UNF
   algorithm is executed is in fact the internal
   data structure used by R to handle date objects, it is
   completely proprietory and thus violates the stated goal
   to use canonical forms of all data objects for signature
   calculation. 
   In the UNF:5+ care is taken to ensure that the date
   values are processed in their canonical form (see
   documentation for UNF:5 for more details).

The 1. above appears to be particularly non-portable. The
Perl manual page suggests that the default behavior of
'sprintf "%g"' is not guaranteed to be the same even between
perl implementations on different platforms.  In the light
of this, it appears that in order to be able to replicate a
UNF:3 signature in a way that's 100% identical to what was
used in the DVN pre-2.0 citations, it is highly advisable to
use the the DSB package (referenced above) on redhat
linux/i386 hardware.



Notes on the R package UNF. 


Please see the documentation that comes with the R package
for more information on how to use the software. As a
reference, below is a brief explanation of how the package
is used by the DSB implementation, with an example that
mirrors the production use.



Note that it is the responsibility of the user to supply
both the data values AND the information about the variable
types. In the DSB/DVN <2.0 implementation the data values
are passed as a tab-delimited file, and the types are
specified in the R code passed to the R environment to be
executed:


library("UNF")
vartyp <-c(
1,
0,
0,
0,
0,
1)
varFmt<-list(
'DATERUN'='D',
'TIME0'='T');
x<-read.table141vdc(file="/tmp/filename.tab", sep="\t", col.names=c(
"REC0",
"SID",
"DATERUN",
"TIME0",
"SEX",
"RACE"),colClassesx=vartyp,varFormat=varFmt,nrows=92)
sumStatTabAll.DDI(dtfrm=x,file="/tmp/filename.out.tab", flid=1, jobNo=0, novars=45)

rm(x) 

Using the DSB scripts to convert SPSS and Stata files to
tab-delimited format: 

The following perl scripts distributed as part of the DSB
rpm can be used to produce tab-delimited files from Stata,
SPSS/por and SPSS/sav respectively: readdta.pl, readpor.pl
and readsav.pl. 

These scripts in turn rely on the following packages
(all in lib/VDC/DSB/Ingest/):

StatData.pm
StatDataFileReaderFactory.pm
DTA.pm
POR.pm
SAV.pm

The code comes with builtin documentation in standard
perldoc format.
