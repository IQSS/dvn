You can schedule harvesting to take place on a regular basis, or you can leave the schedule undefined. A Harvesting dataverse provides most of the same functionality as a regular dataverse with the following differences: 1) You cannot edit a harvested study. 2) You search for the cataloging and variable information (study metadata) locally but you access the files remotely.</p>
