_How to Replciate Analysis_ 


1. If you do not already have 'R' (version 2.7 or later) installed on your 
   computer, install it from:
   
       http://cran.r-project.org

   Note: Some analyses require additional modules, the replication file will
   attempt to install any that are missing, as long as your system is 
   connected to the Internet.


2. Open the accompanying 'zipFile.xxxxxx.xxxxxx.zip' file, and copy the files
   in it to a new location (for example, your desktop).

   Note: This normally contains four files:

    1. citation file            citationFile.xxxxxx.ccccc.txt
    2. tab-delmited data file   dvnSubsetFile.xxxxxx.aaaaa.tab
    3. R-command file           RcommandFile.xxxxxx.ddddd.R
    4. R-function file          vdc_startup.xxxxxx.bbbbb.R

    where xxxxxx is an arbitrary identification number.


3. Run R


4. From the R menus, change the working directoy to the location of the
   replication files (for example, your desktop)

    Note: In windows, from R, use  File -> "Change dir ..."; 
          in Mac OS X, use Misc => "Change Working Directory ..." 


5. Run the R-command file
    
    From R, use File->"Source File", and select the Rcommandfile.xxxxxx.ddddd.R


6. View results -- these will open automatically in your browser.
